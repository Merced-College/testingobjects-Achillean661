Checkpoint Questions:
    Q1: Printing an object with no toString shows the object's memory address encoded as a hex hash. 
    Q2: Name = null, Age = 0, Breed = null. Age in this context is a primitive type due to it being a direct numerical value. The reference
        types are Name and Age as they are recoreded as strings.
    Q3: The constructors change the initialization story by allowing us to enter parameters for variables we're looking for along with having a 
        default constructor for preset variables.
    Q4: Printout in Part D is more standardized and simpler than continual repeititon with Part A.
        Override is useful because it allows us to use the toString method in the respective class.
    Q5: Private fields with getters/setters grant greater security and obscurity when working with sensitive information. Bank pins for example, would
        be significantly less secure when using public fields. (Am aware that a lot of banks still use old obscure languages like COBOL for their databases though)
