**Checkpoint Questions:**
* Q1: Printing an object with no toString shows the object's memory address encoded as a hex hash.
* Q2: Name = null, Age = 0, Breed = null. Age in this context is a primitive type due to it being a direct numerical value. The reference
types are Name and Age as they are recorded as strings.
* Q3: The constructors change the initialization story by allowing us to enter parameters for variables we're looking for along with having a
default constructor for preset variables.
* Q4: Printout in Part D is more standardized and simpler than continual repetition with Part A.
Override is useful because it allows us to use the toString method in the respective class.
* Q5: Private fields with getters/setters grant greater security and obscurity when working with sensitive information. Bank pins for example, would
be significantly less secure when using public fields.

**Reflection & Turn In Questions:**
* Q1: Printing out the object before implementing a toString method only prints out the object's name and memory address, encoded as a hex hash. This is because of the 
default print of classes is their name and hexadecimal information.
* Q2: The Course class' three fields are: 
  * name = "Unknown"
  * credits = 0
  * takingCourse = false
* Q3: The default constructor allows for preset parameters to take place of an empty object class while the parameterized constructor allows us to customize and input information we want into the class.
* Q4: @Override toString allows us to override the default method of printing objects so that we can print out the information we want from our classes.
* Q5: Private fields with getters/setters grant greater security and obscurity when working with sensitive information. Bank pins for example, would
  be significantly less secure when using public fields.
